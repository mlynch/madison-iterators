        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Madison Iterators is an informal, weekly meetup of product creators that runs mid June through mid September. At each meeting, groups share the progress they’ve made since the last meeting, along with challenges they’ve faced and what they plan to accomplish by the next meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Madison Iterators is lead by <a href="http://maxlynch.com/">Max Lynch</a>, co-founder <a href="http://codiqa.com/">Codiqa</a> in Madison, Wisconsin.

        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>
        To encourage startup owners and product developers to “ship” by developing a productive, focused, and honest environment where each group feels accountable to their peers. No bullshit, no fake sales pitches, and no lies about how well you are doing when you aren’t.
        </p>

        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your group must be actively working on a startup or project</li>
          <li>Do not share sensitive information shared during meetings with others outside of the group</li>
          <li>Your group must regularly attend and make regular progress (some missed meetings are fine)</li>
          <li>If you are managing a team, have the team participate instead of yourself. The goal is to help the lowest level</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Experiment</h3>
        <p>
          This is an experiment to see if a rigorous yet informal peer-support group can benefit product developers in the Madison area. There may be some tweaks along the way as we learn and iterate.
